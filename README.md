# Coding-Exercise
This repository contains a simple utility in Java that reads an ASCII input file, reverses its contents, and writes the reversed contents to an output file. The implementation follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring the correctness of the functionality without hitting the file system during unit tests.
